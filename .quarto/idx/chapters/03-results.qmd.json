For systolic pressure, Ksens-BP showed a small positive bias with narrower limits of agreement (mean difference, 0.93 mmHg; limits of agreement, -8.91 to 10.76 mmHg) compared with Oscillo-BP (mean difference, 0.59 mmHg; limits of agreement, -14.17 to 15.35 mmHg). For diastolic pressure, Ksens-BP again demonstrated tighter dispersion and minimal bias (mean difference, 0.41 mmHg; limits of agreement, -7.64 to 8.46 mmHg), whereas Oscillo-BP showed a larger negative bias and wider limits (mean difference, -4.23 mmHg; limits of agreement, -15.85 to 7.40 mmHg), indicating systematic underestimation relative to auscultatory measurements.\n\n```{r}\ntable33_path_candidates <- c(\n  \"outputs/tables/table3-3.csv\",\n  \"../outputs/tables/table3-3.csv\"\n)\ntable33_path <- table33_path_candidates[file.exists(table33_path_candidates)][1]\nif (is.na(table33_path)) {\n  stop(\n    \"'table3-3.csv' not found.

For systolic measurements, the mean absolute difference was 2.0 mmHg for Ksens-BP versus 4.4 mmHg for Oscillo-BP; for diastolic measurements, the corresponding values were 2.3 and 5.4 mmHg. Mean signed differences further indicated directionality of bias: Oscillo-BP was near-neutral for systolic pressure (+0.6 mmHg) but substantially underestimated diastolic pressure (-4.2 mmHg), whereas Ksens-BP remained close to zero for both systolic (+0.9 mmHg) and diastolic (+0.4 mmHg) readings. The between-device comparisons favored Ksens-BP for both systolic and diastolic performance (both p < 0.001).\n\n## Factors Influencing Measurement Differences\n\n```{r}\ntable34_path_candidates <- c(\n  \"outputs/tables/table3-4_sbp_mixedmodel.csv\",\n  \"../outputs/tables/table3-4_sbp_mixedmodel.csv\"\n)\ntable34_path <- table34_path_candidates[file.exists(table34_path_candidates)][1]\nif (is.na(table34_path)) {\n  stop(\n    \"'table3-4_sbp_mixedmodel.csv' not found.

For systolic differences (Table 3-4), male sex was independently associated with larger Oscillo-SBP differences (beta = 2.92 mmHg, 95% CI 1.00 to 4.84; p = 0.003), whereas no corresponding association was observed for Ksens-SBP (beta = -0.03 mmHg, 95% CI -1.03 to 0.98; p = 0.959). No other covariates reached statistical significance for systolic differences in either device model, although diabetes showed a borderline inverse association in the Ksens-SBP model (beta = -0.75 mmHg, 95% CI -1.56 to 0.06; p = 0.070).\n\nFor diastolic differences (Table 3-5), none of the prespecified covariates were statistically significant at the 0.05 level in either device model. In the Ksens-DBP model, higher heart rate showed a borderline negative association with measurement differences (beta = -0.03 mmHg per bpm, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.00; p = 0.052). In the Oscillo-DBP model, atrial fibrillation tended to be associated with larger positive differences (beta = 2.26 mmHg, 95% CI -0.17 to 4.69; p = 0.069), but this did not reach conventional significance. Overall, these findings suggest limited and outcome-specific covariate effects, with the most robust signal observed for sex-related variation in Oscillo-based systolic measurements.\n\n## Subgroup Analyses\n\n```{r fig.cap=\"Figure 3-4.

For systolic absolute error (Figure 3-4), the subgroup-specific estimates were consistently below zero, indicating that Ksens-BP maintained smaller absolute systolic deviation from the auscultatory reference than Oscillo-BP across all prespecified subgroups. No significant between-level contrasts were observed for systolic outcomes (all p > 0.05), suggesting no strong effect modification.\n\nFor diastolic absolute error (Figure 3-5), the overall pattern also favored Ksens-BP, but heterogeneity was evident in selected subgroups. Significant subgroup differences were observed for diabetes (Yes vs No: beta = -1.52 mmHg, 95% CI -2.76 to -0.28; p = 0.016) and PAD (Yes vs No: beta = 5.07 mmHg, 95% CI 1.59 to 8.55; p = 0.005), whereas contrasts by hypertension, other ASCVD, atrial fibrillation, and heart-rate tertiles were not significant. These findings indicate that the comparative diastolic advantage of Ksens-BP was generally robust but varied in magnitude according to specific comorbidity profiles.\n\n## Omron Error Analysis\n\n```{r}\ntable36_path_candidates <- c(\n  \"outputs/tables/table3-6omron_error_descripitive_attempt.csv\",\n  \"../outputs/tables/table3-6omron_error_descripitive_attempt.csv\"\n)\ntable36_path <- table36_path_candidates[file.exists(table36_path_candidates)][1]\nif (is.na(table36_path)) {\n  stop(\n    \"'table3-6omron_error_descripitive_attempt.csv' not found.

Compared with non-error observations, error events were associated with older age, smaller arm circumference, lower BMI, and higher heart rate, with the largest standardized imbalance observed for atrial fibrillation. At the attempt level, atrial fibrillation was substantially more frequent in error attempts (39.9% vs 12.8%; SMD = 0.65), and similar enrichment was observed at the patient level (33.9% vs 7.6%; SMD = 0.69).

In the mixed-effects attempt-level model, atrial fibrillation was associated with markedly increased odds of error (OR, 13.35; 95% CI, 3.00-59.45; p < 0.001), while age, heart rate, arm circumference, sex, and PAD were not statistically significant after adjustment. In the patient-level logistic model, atrial fibrillation remained strongly associated with error (OR, 4.63; 95% CI, 1.91-11.24; p < 0.001), and older age also emerged as an independent predictor (OR per 1 SD, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.04-2.22; p = 0.029). Smaller arm circumference showed a borderline inverse association (OR per 1 SD, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.50-1.02; p = 0.064), and heart rate remained directionally positive but
