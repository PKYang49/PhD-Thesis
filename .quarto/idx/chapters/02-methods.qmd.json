The primary objective was to compare blood pressure (BP) measurements obtained using an automated Korotkoff sound BP monitor (Ksens-BP), an oscillometric BP monitor (Oscillo-BP), and the auscultatory method (Auscl-BP) in patients with cardiovascular disease. All participants provided written informed consent prior to study procedures.\n\nBased on a target concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) of 0.80, with the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval set at 0.70 and 80% power, the required sample size was estimated at 170 participants. Considering a potential dropout rate of up to 15%, the recruitment target was set at 200 participants.\n\n## Study Population\n\nParticipants were recruited from the cardiovascular outpatient department of National Cheng Kung University Hospital, Douliu Branch, Taiwan, from October 2023 to January 2024. Inclusion criteria were age >= 18 years and at least one of the following conditions:\n\n- Hypertension\n- Diabetes mellitus (DM)\n- Stroke\n- Myocardial infarction (MI)\n- Coronary artery disease (CAD) confirmed by coronary angiography or computed tomography with >= 50% stenosis\n- Peripheral artery disease (PAD) confirmed by angiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or Doppler ultrasound with >= 50% stenosis\n- Atrial fibrillation (AF)\n- Heart failure (HF) with left ventricular ejection fraction < 50% or prior hospitalization for pulmonary edema due to HF\n\nExclusion criteria included upper arm injury or surgery preventing cuff placement, or the presence of an arteriovenous fistula/graft for dialysis.\n\n## Instrumentation and Integrated Measurement Apparatus\n\nTo reduce BP variability from sequential measurements, all three modalities (Ksens-BP, Oscillo-BP, and Auscl-BP) were integrated into a single experimental assembly.\n\n```{r fig.cap=\"Figure 2.1. Schematic block diagram of the integrated experimental system. (1) Controller, (2) BP cuff with embedded K-Sensor, (3) oscillometric BP device, (4) stethoscope, (5) trigger device, and (6) computer.

Checked:\\n\",\n    paste(fig21_path_candidates, collapse = \"\\n\")\n  )\n}\nknitr::include_graphics(fig21_path)\n```\n\n### Central Controller\n\nA custom-designed controller based on an RL78H1D microcontroller unit (MCU) controlled cuff inflation/deflation, synchronized signal acquisition, and supported user operations (measurement start, date/time setting, and data review). Signals from the K-Sensor, stethoscope audio, and trigger device were routed to the controller and forwarded to a host computer for real-time computation, visualization, and storage.\n\n### K-Sensor\n\nThe K-Sensor consisted of a semiconductor piezoresistive strain gauge mounted on a phosphor bronze base plate (approximately 25 mm diameter x 3 mm thickness), enclosed in an aluminum frame, with a biocompatible skin-contacting film. The sensor was embedded directly in a standard upper-arm cuff and positioned over the brachial artery.\n\n```{r fig.cap=\"Figure 2.2. Setup of the K-Sensor BP monitor. During cuff deflation, the K-Sensor continuously captures arterial wall vibrations associated with Korotkoff sounds. The signal is transmitted to a pretrained host-computer model to determine Ksens-BP.\"}\nfig22_path_candidates <- c(\n  \"output/figures/External/2-2.png\",\n  \"outputs/figures/External/2-2.png\",\n  \"../output/figures/External/2-2.png\",\n  \"../outputs/figures/External/2-2.png\"\n)\nfig22_path <- fig22_path_candidates[file.exists(fig22_path_candidates)][1]\nif (is.na(fig22_path)) {\n  stop(\n    \"'2-2.png' not found. Checked:\\n\",\n    paste(fig22_path_candidates, collapse = \"\\n\")\n  )\n}\nknitr::include_graphics(fig22_path)\n```\n\n### Ksens-BP Acquisition\n\nDuring each automated Ksens-BP measurement, cuff pressure and K-Sensor vibration signals were recorded synchronously. The cuff was inflated to a suprasystolic level and deflated in a controlled manner. A pretrained classification model was applied to the deflation-period K-Sensor waveform to detect Korotkoff-related segments (label 1 for Korotkoff sound present, label 0 for absent). These labels were mapped to the simultaneously recorded cuff-pressure trace. Ksens-SBP was defined at the first segment labeled 1 (onset of Korotkoff sounds), and Ksens-DBP at the last segment labeled 1 (disappearance of Korotkoff sounds). When needed, cuff pressure at these time points was obtained by time alignment and interpolation.\n\n```{r fig.cap=\"Figure 2.3. Schematic diagram of the Ksens-BP determination process.

The Omron tubing was connected to the same cuff with embedded K-Sensor to ensure identical cuff pressure conditions. Oscillo-BP values were read from the device after deflation and recorded by research staff.\n\n### Auscultatory BP\n\nA standard medical-grade stethoscope diaphragm was positioned over the antecubital fossa and fixed with an elastic strap. The stethoscope acoustic signal was routed through a bifurcated circuit and converted to an electrical signal for controller input. During each measurement, trained healthcare personnel listened to Korotkoff sounds and pressed a handheld trigger button for each detected Korotkoff sound, from first sound (SBP) to last sound (DBP). The host computer automatically recorded Auscl-BP values according to trigger timing and corresponding cuff pressure.\n\nTo minimize bias, the auscultating healthcare professional and the host-computer operator were separated. The auscultating professional was blinded to real-time signals and computed BP values.\n\n## Experimental Protocol\n\nAll measurements were performed in a quiet, temperature-controlled room, with participants seated and rested for at least 5 minutes before data collection. The sequence was:\n\n1. Cuff inflation to 180 mmHg (or higher if baseline BP exceeded this level).\n2. Controlled deflation at approximately 5 mmHg/s.\n3. During deflation, simultaneous K-Sensor signal recording and auscultatory trigger marking for Ksens-BP and Auscl-BP derivation.\n4. After complete deflation, on-screen Oscillo-BP values were recorded.\n5. Three consecutive measurements per participant with a 1-minute rest interval; failed measurements were repeated, allowing up to five attempts.\n\n```{r fig.cap=\"Figure 2.4.

Continuous variables are presented as mean +/- SD and categorical variables as n (%).\n\nAgreement between devices and the auscultatory reference was evaluated using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) with 95% confidence intervals and Bland-Altman analysis (mean bias and 95% limits of agreement). Method differences were summarized by mean difference, SD, and mean absolute difference, and absolute errors were compared using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.\n\nFactors associated with measurement differences were assessed using linear mixed-effects models with participant-level random intercepts. Subgroup analyses were also performed using mixed-effects models with estimated marginal means.\n\nOscillo-BP error was analyzed at attempt and patient levels using descriptive comparisons and logistic regression models (mixed-effects logistic model for attempt-level data and standard logistic model for patient-level data). Odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals are reported. All tests were two-sided, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":false,"output":true,"warning":false,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"message":false,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"02-methods.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
