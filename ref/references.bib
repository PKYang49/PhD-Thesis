K-sounds is also unique for diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, however, its efficacy is limited. Heart failure (HF) incidences are increasing, which necessitates the development of a rapid and convenient pre-hospital screening method.

	title = {Device and method for measuring blood pressure and computer program product thereof},
	abstract = {A device for measuring blood pressure receives a vibration signal from a vibration sensor 111 which is used to measure a target area. The device converts the vibration signal into a digital signal S1 and performs a filtering process on the digital signal. The filtering process removes noise around the principal component wave (N1, figure 5) that corresponds to the pulsation of the target area within a specific range in the digital signal. Based on the filtered digital signal that, the device determines a systolic pressure determination time point and a diastolic pressure determination time point to generate a blood pressure measurement result E1. The filtering may remove components of greater than 70 Hz and less than 15 Hz. The vibration sensor may be in a Wheatstone bridge arrangement with three resistors (figure 3). The filtering may be by a digital finite impulse response filter. The vibration sensor may be a piezoresistive strain gauge with a metal diaphragm (figure 2).},

              Blood pressure (BP) measurement in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients is problematic and automated monitors are regarded as inaccurate. The optimal procedure for validating BP monitors in AF is questionable. This study evaluated the accuracy of a novel professional oscillometric upper-arm cuff device (Microlife WatchBP Office), which has an algorithm for detecting AF and then applies an AF-specific BP measurement algorithm. BP variability, which is inherently increased in AF patients, was considered in the analysis.
            
            
              Methods:
              Subjects with sustained AF were included in a validation study using the same arm sequential measurement method of the Universal Standard (ISO 81060-2:2018) for special populations. Analysis was performed in all subjects and separately in those with and without high reference BP variability ({\textgreater}12/8 mmHg SBP/DBP).
            
            
              Results:
              
                Thirty-five subjects with 105 paired test/reference BP measurements were included (mean age 76.3 ± 8.4 years, reference SBP/DBP 128.2 ± 19.5/72.5 ± 12.1 mmHg, pulse rate 68.3 ± 14.9 bpm). Validation
                Criterion 1
                (mean difference ± SD) was 0.0 ± 7.7/0.2 ± 7.0 mmHg in all 105 BP pairs (threshold ≤5 ± 8 mmHg).
                Criterion 1
                was 0.5 ± 6.1/−0.2 ± 6.8 mmHg in 18 subjects (54 BP pairs) with low reference BP variability and −0.6 ± 9.2/0.6 ± 7.3 mmHg in 17 (51 pairs) with high variability.

	abstract = {Objectives
              This study aimed to identify whether automated oscillometric blood pressure monitor (AOBPM) is a reliable blood pressure (BP) measurement tool in geriatric patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with high variability in BP and to evaluate whether it can be applied in practice.
            
            
              Methods
              Electronic searches were performed in databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL by using the following keywords: ‘atrial fibrillation,’ ‘atrial flutter, ‘blood pressure monitor’, ‘sphygmomanometer.’ The QUADAS-2 was applied to assess the internal validity of selected studies. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 program. Design: Systematic review.
            
            
              Results
              We identified 10 studies, including 938 geriatric patients with AF. We compared with the previously used BP measurement method (mainly office) and AOBPM, and the patients with AF were divided into the AF-AF (atrial fibrillation rhythm continued) and AF-SR groups (sinus rhythm recovered). The difference in the systolic BP was −3.0 mmHg [95\% confidence interval (CI): −6.58 to 0.59] and −1.62 (95\% CI: −6.08 to 2.84) mmHg in the AF-AF and AF-SR groups, respectively. The difference in the diastolic BP was 0.17 (95\% CI: −2.90 to 3.25) mmHg and −0.23 (95\% CI: −5.11 to 4.65) mmHg, respectively.
            
            
              Conclusion
              This review showed that the BP difference from AOBPM compared with the auscultatory BP method was less than 5 mmHg in the elderly with AF. This difference is acceptable in clinical practice. However, AOBPM compared with invasive arterial BP in the diastolic BP was a difference of 5 mmHg or more, and so its accuracy cannot be assured.},

The frequency ranges of the sounds have already been described simply using the overall peak frequencies within each phase by Fourier methods. However, such analysis may be missing potentially useful clinical information. The aim of this study was to compare features associated with the different phases of the Korotkoff sounds obtained during blood pressure measurement using a joint time-frequency analysis (JTFA) technique. A single operator recorded Korotkoff sounds from 25 healthy subjects using a measurement system comprising cardiology stethoscope, microphone, amplifier and recording system for computer sound digitization, and a MiniDisc system for playback to the cardiologist for Korotkoff phase classification. We have shown that using this system the phase classification by the cardiologist is repeatable, with no significant differences found in the number of sounds allocated to phases on two separate recording assessments. The digitized sounds were processed using a MATLAB-based short-time Fourier transform JTFA technique and differences in time, frequency and amplitude characteristics between the phases compared. It was found that on average, phase III had the largest overall amplitude and high frequency energy. Phase II had the greatest high frequency component and longest murmur, and was visibly the most complex phase in terms of time and frequency content. In contrast, phases IV and V had the lowest amplitude and frequency components. Overall, the statistically significant transitions between phases were: phase I to II with increases in high frequency (224 to 275 Hz) (p {\textless} 0.01) and sound duration (49 to 98 ms) (p {\textless} 0.0001), II to III with a significant decrease in sound duration (to 37 ms) (p {\textless} 0.0001), III to IV with decreases in maximum amplitude (0.95 to 0.25), highest frequency (262 to 95 Hz), and relative high frequency energy of the sounds (0.61 to 0.10) (all p {\textless} 0.0001), and IV to V with decreases in the maximum amplitude (0.25 to 0.13) (p {\textless} 0.0002) and high frequency energy (0.10 to 0.03) (p {\textless} 0.005). This study has demonstrated that joint time-frequency analysis of Korotkoff sounds was able to identify characteristic differences associated with the different phases classified by the expert cardiologist. Ultimately, exploiting the joint time and frequency characteristics of the sounds may improve blood pressure measurement and help to assess the stiffness of the peripheral arteries.},

	abstract = {Obtaining pulse pressure non-invasively from applanation tonometry requires the calibration of pressure waveform with brachial systolic and diastolic blood pressure. In the literature, several calibration methodologies are applied, and clinical studies disagree about the predictive value of central hemodynamic parameters. Our aim was to compare 4 calibration methodologies and assess the usefulness of pulse pressure amplification as an index independent of calibration. We investigated 108 subjects with tonometry in carotid, femoral, brachial, radial and dorsalis-pedis arteries; pulse pressure amplification between arterial waveforms was calculated. Four methods to calibrate the waveforms were compared: the 1/3 rule, the 40\% rule, the integral of radial and brachial waveforms. Pulse pressure amplification in 5 arterial territories (carotid-femoral, carotid-brachial, carotid-radial and carotid-pedis amplifications; femoral-pedis amplification) was studied. Pulse pressure was successfully measured non-invasively at the 5 arterial sites. Pulse pressure was markedly dependent on calibration, with differences up to 18 mmHg between methods. Calculation of pulse pressure amplification eliminated effects of calibration method. Furthermore, pulse pressure amplifications in the 5 arterial sites presented a distinct pattern of clinical/biological determinants: heart rate and body height were common determinants of carotid to brachial, radial and femoral amplifications; diabetes was related to carotid to brachial amplification and pulse wave velocity to femoral to pedis amplification. In conclusion, the calibration of pulse pressure will influence results of clinical trials, but calculation of pulse pressure amplification can avoid this. We also suggest that the alteration of amplification in each arterial territory might be considered as a signal of clinical/subclinical damage.},

	abstract = {Hypertension is the most important modifiable cause of cardiovascular (CV) disease and all-cause mortality worldwide. Despite the positive correlations between blood pressure (BP) levels and later CV events since BP levels as low as 100/60 mmHg have been reported in numerous epidemiological studies, the diagnostic criteria of hypertension and BP thresholds and targets of antihypertensive therapy have largely remained at the level of 140/90 mmHg in the past 30 years. The publication of both the SPRINT and STEP trials (comprising {\textgreater} 8,500 Caucasian/African and Chinese participants, respectively) provided evidence to shake this 140/90 mmHg dogma. Another dogma regarding hypertension management is the dependence on office (or clinic) BP measurements. Although standardized office BP measurements have been widely recommended and adopted in large-scale CV outcome trials, the practice of office BP measurements has never been ideal in real-world practice. Home BP monitoring (HBPM) is easy to perform, more likely to be free of environmental and/or emotional stress, feasible to document long-term BP variations, of good reproducibility and reliability, and more correlated with hypertension-mediated organ damage (HMOD) and CV events, compared to routine office BP measurements. In the 2022 Taiwan Hypertension Guidelines of the Taiwan Society of Cardiology (TSOC) and the Taiwan Hypertension Society (THS), we break these two dogmas by recommending the definition of hypertension as ≥ 130/80 mmHg and a universal BP target of {\textless} 130/80 mmHg, based on standardized HBPM obtained according to the 722 protocol. The 722 protocol refers to duplicate BP readings taken per occasion ("2"), twice daily ("2"), over seven consecutive days ("7"). To facilitate implementation of the guidelines, a series of flowcharts encompassing assessment, adjustment, and HBPM-guided hypertension management are provided. Other key messages include that: 1) lifestyle modification, summarized as the mnemonic S-ABCDE, should be applied to people with elevated BP and hypertensive patients to reduce life-time BP burden; 2) all 5 major antihypertensive drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [A], angiotensin receptor blockers [A], β-blockers [B], calcium-channel blockers [C], and thiazide diuretics [D]) are recommended as first-line antihypertensive drugs; 3) initial combination therapy, preferably in a single-pill combination, is recommended for patients with BP ≥ 20/10 mmHg above targets; 4) a target hierarchy (HBPM-HMOD- ambulatory BP monitoring [ABPM]) should be considered to optimize hypertension management, which indicates reaching the HBPM target first and then keeping HMOD stable or regressed, otherwise ABPM can be arranged to guide treatment adjustment; and 5) renal denervation can be considered as an alternative BP-lowering strategy after careful clinical and imaging evaluation.},

	abstract = {The introduction of automated oscillometric blood pressure monitors was the basis for today’s widespread use of blood pressure self-measurement. However, in atrial fibrillation, there is a controversial debate on the use of oscillometry because there is a high variability of heart rate and stroke volume. To date, the accuracy of oscillometric blood pressure monitoring in atrial fibrillation has only been investigated using auscultatory sphygmomanometry as reference method, which may be biased by arrhythmia as well. We performed a cross-sectional study in 102 patients (52 sinus rhythm, 50 atrial fibrillation) assessing the accuracy of an automated and validated oscillometric upper arm (M5 Professional, Omron) and wrist device (R5 Professional, Omron) to invasively assessed arterial pressure. Blood pressure values were calculated as the mean of 3 consecutive measurements. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not significantly differ in patients with sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation, independent of the method of measurement (
              P
              {\textgreater}0.05 each). The within-subject variability of the oscillometric measurements was higher in patients with atrial fibrillation compared with sinus rhythm (

            Subject
            Using intro-aortic BP as reference,to compare the accuracy of a Korotkoff sound electronic device (Hanvon FY730) and an oscillometric device (Omron HBP-1320T3) in BP measurement,
          
          
            Methods
            BP was measured in catheterization coronary angiography. A crossover design was adopted for the using sequence of the two kinds of devices. The average of two BP readings were recorded as the final SBP, DBP and mean arterial pressure (MAP). Non-invasive BP measurement was initiated when the intro-aortic BP curve was stabilized, and the intro-aortic BP curve was simultaneously recorded for 15–20 seconds. BP differences (ΔBP) between non-invasive and its relative intro-aortic BP values were calculated as Oscillometric BP – intro-aortic BP difference (Osc-Ao) or Korotkoff sound method – intro-aortic BP difference (Kor-Ao).
          
          
            Results
            Using intro-aortic BP as the reference, the Korotkoff sound device provided closer readings compared to the oscillometric device.The Kor-Ao SBP was 19.5 ± 17.6 mmHg, but Osc-Ao SBP was 24.8 ± 20.2 mmHg (P {\textless} 0.001). Similarly, the MAP difference was smaller for the Korotkoff device (10.5 ± 10.9 mmHg vs. 13.7 ± 11.3 mmHg, P = 0.007). Although the DBP difference was also smaller for the Korotkoff device (6.1 ± 12.3 mmHg vs. 8.1 ± 11.5 mmHg), but no statistical significance (P = 0.147).
          
          
            Conclusion
            Using intro-aortic BP reading as reference, the Korotkoff sound device provides more accurate brachial SBP, DBP and MAP values against the oscillometric device.},

A clinical trial involving 86 eligible adults was conducted, and data were analyzed based on standardized protocols. The mean differences between the device and reference measurements for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were −0.37 mmHg (SD: 2.25 mmHg) and −0.17 mmHg (SD: 2.02 mmHg), respectively. Standard deviations for SBP (≤6.93 mmHg) and DBP (≤6.95 mmHg) met the required thresholds. A total of 258 effective paired measurements demonstrated that the Hanvon FY730 provides highly consistent results compared with reference methods, with all deviations falling within acceptable limits. The study also confirmed the device’s reliability across a wide range of arm circumferences (22–36 cm) and BP levels (SBP: 90–188 mmHg, DBP: 53–107 mmHg). These findings confirm that the Hanvon FY730 complies with ISO 81060-2:2018 standards, demonstrating its suitability for accurate BP monitoring in clinical, personal, and home settings.},

	abstract = {Objective
              A novel automated auscultatory upper arm cuff blood pressure (BP) monitor KOROT V2 Doctor (InBody BPBIO280KV) was developed for professional use. An electronic stethoscope embedded in the device cuff records the Korotkoff sounds, which are graphically displayed during deflation allowing visual evaluation by the healthcare professional. The device provides automated measurements of BP and this study evaluated its accuracy.
            
            
              Methods
              The requirements of the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation/European Society of Hypertension/International Organization for Standardization (AAMI/ESH/ISO) Universal Standard (ISO 81060-2:2018) and its Amendment 1.2020-01 were applied. Participants were recruited to fulfill the age, sex, BP, arm circumference, and cuff distribution criteria of the Universal Standard and its Amendment in a general population using the same arm sequential measurement method. Three cuffs of the test device were tested for arm circumference 23–28, 28–35, and 33–42 cm.
            
            
              Results
              
                Data from 85 individuals were analyzed [mean age: 56.4 ± 16.0 (SD) years, 50 men, arm circumference 23–42 cm]. For validation Criterion 1, the mean difference ±SD between the test device and reference BP readings (
                N
                 = 255) was −1.3 ± 6.0/1.5 ± 5.0 mmHg (systolic/diastolic; threshold ≤5 ± 8 mmHg). For Criterion 2, the SD of the averaged BP differences per individual (
                N
                 = 85) was 4.61/3.48 mmHg (systolic/diastolic; threshold ≤6.82/6.78 mmHg).
              
            
            
              Conclusion
              The KOROT V2 Doctor (InBody BPBIO280KV) device for professional use, which provides automated auscultatory measurements with visual display of the Korotkoff sounds, comfortably fulfills all the requirements of the AAMI/ESH/ISO Universal Standard (ISO 81060-2:2018) in a general population and can be recommended for clinical use.},

	title = {A study using semiconductor strain gauge sensor and artificial intelligence algorithm to interpret {Korotkoff} sound signals},
	abstract = {The medical standard for non-invasive blood pressure measurement is based on the Korotkoff sounds (K-sounds). The traditional method requires dedicated personnel to auscultate, observe the pressure displayed by the instrument, and manually record blood pressure data, which could lead to operational errors. The most common method of automatically measuring K-sounds is to record these sounds with a stethoscope and then use artificial intelligence to identify the audio signals. The challenge with this approach, however, is that the microphone must be able to filter out ambient noise. In contract to other research teams, we chose semiconductor strain gauges as the main measurement elements and designed a “K-sensor” based on alloy copper sheets. The key to this design is that it enhances intravascular hemodynamic signals while remaining unaffected by environmental noise. Considering that visual cues are often more precise than auditory ones, this study further designed a verification method to couple the vibration signal waveforms with K-sounds, to visualize the K-sounds as waveform diagrams. The AI interpretation model we built through 2D-CNN (ResNet50V2) was utilized to verify whether the individual waveform obtained by the K-sensor is coupled with K-sounds. The test result is an accuracy of 0.95, a recall (or "sensitivity") of 0.91, a specificity of 0.98, and a precision of 0.97. We believe that combining this K-sensor with our AI interpretation model can effectively detect K-sounds, paving the way for the development of automated K-sound electronic sphygmomanometers.},

            Real‐time monitoring of vital sounds from cardiovascular and respiratory systems via wearable devices together with modern data analysis schemes have the potential to reveal a variety of health conditions. Here, a flexible piezoelectret sensing system is developed to examine audio physiological signals in an unobtrusive manner, including heart, Korotkoff, and breath sounds. A customized electromagnetic shielding structure is designed for precision and high‐fidelity measurements and several unique physiological sound patterns related to clinical applications are collected and analyzed. At the left chest location for the heart sounds, the S1 and S2 segments related to cardiac systole and diastole conditions, respectively, are successfully extracted and analyzed with good consistency from those of a commercial medical device. At the upper arm location, recorded Korotkoff sounds are used to characterize the systolic and diastolic blood pressure without a doctor or prior calibration. An Omron blood pressure monitor is used to validate these results. The breath sound detections from the lung/ trachea region are achieved a signal‐to‐noise ration comparable to those of a medical recorder, BIOPAC, with pattern classification capabilities for the diagnosis of viable respiratory diseases. Finally, a 6×6 sensor array is used to record heart sounds at different locations of the chest area simultaneously, including the Aortic, Pulmonic, Erb's point, Tricuspid, and Mitral regions in the form of mixed data resulting from the physiological activities of four heart valves. These signals are then separated by the independent component analysis algorithm and individual heart sound components from specific heart valves can reveal their instantaneous behaviors for the accurate diagnosis of heart diseases. The combination of these demonstrations illustrate a new class of wearable healthcare detection system for potentially advanced diagnostic schemes.},

            This paper proposes a method that automatically measures non-invasive blood pressure (BP) based on an auscultatory approach using Korotkoff sounds (K-sounds). There have been methods utilizing K-sounds that were more accurate in general than those using cuff pressure signals only under well-controlled environments, but most were vulnerable to the measurement conditions and to external noise because blood pressure is simply determined based on threshold values in the sound signal. The proposed method enables robust and precise BP measurements by evaluating the probability that each sound pulse is an audible K-sound based on a deep learning using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Instead of classifying sound pulses into two categories, audible K-sounds and others, the proposed CNN model outputs probability values. These values in a Korotkoff cycle are arranged in time order, and the blood pressure is determined. The proposed method was tested with a dataset acquired in practice that occasionally contains considerable noise, which can degrade the performance of the threshold-based methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms a previously reported CNN-based classification method using K-sounds. With larger amounts of various types of data, the proposed method can potentially achieve more precise and robust results.},

However, oscillometric measurements are population-dependent, and manual auscultation relies heavily on operator skill. This study introduces the modulated Short-Time Energy and finding the peaks (mSTEP) algorithm, designed to automate the tracking of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from auscultatory signals, aiming to provide accurate BP measurements. The mSTEP algorithm was rigorously evaluated on a dataset comprising 350 recordings with manually annotated SBP and DBP for ground truth value. Implementation of the algorithm yielded successful identification of both SBP and DBP, with errors of -1.5 ± 6.6 mmHg and 3.8 ± 7.6 mmHg, respectively, with insignificant bias (p{\textless}0.0001). The agreement between mSTEP algorithm results and the reference measurement was strong and statistically significant, exhibiting correlation coefficients (r) of 0.94 (p{\textless}0.0001) for SBP and 0.79 (p{\textless}0.0001) for DBP. Bland-Altman plots further supported strong agreement, with confidence intervals of -14.5 mmHg to 11.4 mmHg for SBP and - 11.1 mmHg to 18.6 mmHg for DBP. According to the performance assessment, the algorithm received an 'A' grade in the BHS grading system and successfully met the accuracy requirements prescribed by AAMI/ANSI and ISO. The proposed algorithm potentially leads to the development of automated devices for accurate blood pressure measurements without depending on population or individual-level calibration coefficients.},

	abstract = {Measurement of blood pressure (BP) through manual auscultation and the observation of Korotkoff sounds (KSs) remains the gold standard in BP methodology. Critical to determining BP levels via auscultation is the determination of KS audibility. While absolute sound level audibility is well researched, the problem has not been approached from the point of view of psychoacoustic masking of the sounds. Here, during manual auscultation of BP, a direct comparison is made between what an observer perceives as audible and the electronic analysis of audibility level determined from masking of sound signal levels. KSs are collected during auscultation with an electronic stethoscope, which allows simultaneously observing sound audibility and recording the sound electronically. By time-segmenting the recorded sound around Korotkoff peaks into a test segment and a masking segment, performing Fourier transforms on the segments, and comparing frequency-band sound energy levels, signal-to-noise ratios of a sound to its masking counterpart can be defined. Comparing these ratios to difference limen in the psychoacoustic masking literature, an approximate threshold for sound audibility is obtained. It is anticipated that this approach could have profound effects on future development of automated auscultation BP measurements.},

This study investigated whether the review of Korotkoff sound curves by healthcare professionals further improves the accuracy of the device by identifying unreliable BP readings.
            
            
              Methods:
              Three observers assessed independently the morphology of Korotkoff sound curves of BP measurements obtained during an ISO 81060-2:2018 validation study, and classified them as of good, fair, or poor quality (low amplitude or sound intensity, aberrant morphology, background noise, signal artifact, auscultatory gap, irregular rhythm). The observers were blinded to the study BP measurements.
            
            
              Results:
              Korotkoff sound curves of 255 BP readings obtained in 85 individuals were analyzed (mean age 57.3 ± 15.0 years, 53 men). Of the SBP readings 80.4/12.2/7.4\% were classified as good/fair/poor, and DBP 76.9/12.2/10.9\%. Inter-observer agreement in detecting poor-quality curves was 84.7/83.1\% (systolic/diastolic). Of poor-quality curves, 10.5/60.7\% (systolic/diastolic) clustered in the same individuals. The validation criterion 1 [mean test-reference BP difference ≤5 ± 8 (SD) mmHg] was satisfied for readings with good (0.1 ± 4.9/0.3 ± 3.8 mmHg, systolic/diastolic) and fair-quality curves (−0.4 ± 6.4/0.2 ± 5.0), but not for poor-quality ones (2.7 ± 8.8/3.6 ± 8.1). By excluding poor-quality readings (40 of 255), criterion 1 of the validation study was improved (0.2 ± 4.9/0.2 ± 3.9 versus 0.3 ± 5.5/0.6 ± 4.7 mmHg).

SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 110 consecutive subjects including symptomatic PAD patients (n = 41) and healthy PAD-free participants (n = 69) were recruited. All subjects underwent standard manual Doppler-based ABI (sABI) and oscillometry-based automated ABI (aABI) measurements (VascAssist). Oscillometry by the VascAssist included central and peripheral PWV assessment. Additionally, arterial stiffness (AS) was evaluated by flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery in all patients. All symptomatic PAD patients underwent catheter angiography for endovascular intervention and post-interventional acquisition of sABI, aABI, PWV and FMD.
RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of aABI for detecting PAD was 73\%, 100\%, 100\%, and 86\% as compared to 80\%, 96\%, 92\%, and 89\% for sABI. Pearson-correlation for diabetics was r = 0.81; (P {\textless} .001) and for non-diabetics r = 0.77; (P {\textless} .001). Bland-Altman-analysis revealed a difference (95\% CI) for diabetics of 0.09 (-0.22-0.4] and non-diabetics 0.022 [-0.25-0.295]. Weak correlation exists for FMD/AS analysis (pre-interventional R = 0.386, P = .043; post-interventional R = -0.06; P = .76) and significant increase of pre-/post-interventional PWV analysis (P {\textless} .001).
CONCLUSION: Combined automatic ABI and PWV acquisition with the VascAssist device showed excellent diagnostic accuracy for detection of PAD. Compared to FMD, AS analysis may serve as an investigator-independent (screening) tool for determination of functional vascular damage in atherosclerosis.},

	abstract = {Objectives:
              Oscillometric blood pressure (BP) measurement in atrial fibrillation patients is controversial due to stroke volume variation. Here, we performed a cross-sectional study to investigate the impact of atrial fibrillation on the accuracy of oscillometric BP in the ICU setting.
            
            
              Methods:
              Adult patients with atrial fibrillation or sinus rhythm records were enrolled from Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-III database. Concurrently recorded noninvasive oscillometric BPs (NIBPs) and intra-arterial BPs (IBPs) were classified as atrial fibrillation or sinus rhythm group according to heart rhythm. Bland–Altmann plots assessed bias and limits of agreement of NIBP to IBP. Pairwise comparison was performed on NIBP/IBP bias between atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm. Linear mixed-effect model was used to assess the impact of heart rhythm on NIBP/IBP bias after adjusting confounders.
            
            
              Results:
              
                Two thousand, three hundred and thirty-five patients (71.95 ± 11.23 years old, 60.90\% were men) were included. Systolic, diastolic, and mean NIBP/IBP biases were not clinically different between atrial fibrillation and sinus rhythm circumstances (SBP bias: 0.66 vs. 1.21 mmHg,
                P
                 = 0.002; DBP: −5.29 vs. −5.17,
                P
                 = 0.1; mean BP: −4.45 vs. −4.19,
                P
                 = 0.01). After adjusting for age, sex, heart rate, arterial BP, and vasopressor usage, the effect of heart rhythm on NIBP/IBP bias was within ±5 mmHg for SBP and DBP [effect on SBP bias: 3.32 mmHg (95\% confidence interval (CI) 2.89–3.74),
                P
                 {\textless} 0.001; DBP: −0.89 (−1.17 to −0.60),
                P
                 {\textless} 0.001], while the effect on mean BP bias was not significant [0.18 mmHg (−0.10 to 0.46),
                P
                 = 0.2].
              
            
            
              Conclusion:
              Atrial fibrillation would not influence the agreement of oscillometric BP to IBP in ICU patients compared with sinus rhythm.},

The advantages of oscillometric noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) measurement are its easy and fast methodology; however, the accuracy and the precision of this measurement in critically ill patients is constantly debated. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies comparing oscillometric NIBP methods with invasive arterial pressure (IAP) measurements. We included studies of adult critically ill patients, which evaluated MAP in the same patient by both NIBP and IAP at any site. We included only studies comparing simultaneous measurements of arterial pressure by NIBP and IAP, reporting their results using mean difference and SD of agreement. The main outcome was to define the bias of the MAP measured by NIBP over the IAP measurement. The quality of the studies was analysed by the QUADAS 2 tool. Seven studies and 1593 patients were included in the main analysis. The oscillometric NIBP method had a mean value of -1.50 mmHg when compared with IAP (95\% CI: –3.34 to 0.35; I2 = 96\% for random effects model, P {\textless} 0.01). The limits of agreement for MAP varied between –14.6 mmHg and +40.3 mmHg. NIBP had an adequate accuracy regarding MAP measurements by oscillometry. Limits of agreement may thus narrow the clinical applicability in scenarios in which there is a need for a more precise management of blood pressure.},

	abstract = {Objective: 
          Noninvasive blood pressure (NIBP) devices are calibrated against validated auscultation sphygmomanometers using Korotkoff sounds. This study aimed to investigate the timing of Korotkoff sounds in relation to pulse appearance in the brachial artery and values of intra-arterial blood pressure.
          Design and method: 
          Experiments were carried out on 15 participants, (14 males, 64.3 ±10.4 years; one female, 86 yo), undergoing coronary angiography. A conventional (oscillometric) BP cuff, with a microphone for Korotkoff sounds, was placed on the upper arm. Intra-arterial brachial artery pressure (IABP) was measured below the cuff with a fluid-filled catheter inserted via the radial artery and an external transducer. Finger photoplethysmography was used to measure brachial pulse wave velocity (PWV). Korotkoff sounds were processed electronically and custom algorithms identified the cuff pressure (CP) at which the first and last Korotkoff sounds were heard. PWV and max slope of the IABP pressure pulse were recorded to estimate arterial stiffness.
          Results: 
          The brachial artery closed at a CP of 132.0±17.1 mmHg. Systolic (SBP), and diastolic (DBP) pressure were 147.6±14.3 and 72.7±10.1mmHg; mean pressure (MP, 100.1±10.4 mmHg) was similar to MP derived from the peak of the oscillogram (98.5±13.6 mmHg). Difference between IABP and CP recorded at first and last occurrence of Korotkoff sounds were, SBP: 18.9±8.3 (range 2-29) mmHg, DBP: 4.0±4.3 (range -1.6 -12.4) mmHg. Multiple linear regression showed that differences increase with arterial stiffness and can be compensated for using a prediction equation for calculation of true SBP (tSBP) using heart rate (HR) and Korotkoff derived systolic (SBPk) and diastolic (DBPk), at least over the limited age range for this study cohort.
          Conclusions: 
          SBP and DBP derived from the onset and termination of Korotkoff sounds can underestimate IABP by up to 29 mmHg. Since Korotkoff sounds are the recommended method mandated by the universal standard for the validation of blood pressure measuring devices, these errors are propagated through to all NIBP measurement devices irrespective of whether they use auscultatory or oscillometric methods thus explaining the well known differences recorded between NIBP measurements and intra-arterial BP measurements.},

	abstract = {Abstract—Oscillometric blood pressure devices tend to overestimate systolic blood pressure and underestimate diastolic blood pressure compared with sphygmomanometers. Recent studies indicate that discrepancies in performance between these devices may differ between healthy and diabetic subjects. Arterial stiffness in diabetics could be the underlying factor explaining these differences. We studied differences between a Dinamap oscillometric blood pressure monitor and a random-zero sphygmomanometer in relation to arterial stiffness in 1808 healthy elderly subjects. The study was conducted within the Rotterdam Study, a population-based cohort study of subjects aged 55 years and older. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure differences between a Dinamap and a random-zero sphygmomanometer were related to arterial stiffness, as measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity. Increased arterial stiffness was associated with higher systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings by the Dinamap compared with the random-zero sphygmomanometer, independent of age, gender, and average mean blood pressure level of both devices. The β-coefficient (95\% CI) was 0.25 (0.00 to 0.50) mm Hg/(m/s) for the systolic blood pressure difference and 0.35 (0.20 to 0.50) mm Hg/(m/s) for the diastolic blood pressure difference. The results indicate that a Dinamap oscillometric blood pressure device, in comparison to a random-zero sphygmomanometer, overestimates systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings in subjects with stiff arteries.},

Therefore, evaluation of BP values in AF patients remains a challenge. This study included 251 patients with AF and 154 participants with sinus rhythm (SR). Pulse rate (PR) and BP were measured using an oscillometric device three times. The differences between the highest and lowest PR and the systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) were calculated as ΔPR, ΔSBP and ΔDBP, respectively. AF patients were stratified with respect to ΔPR in 0–5, 6–10, 11–15 and {\textgreater}15 subgroups. The AF group had a greater ΔPR (12.1±8.6 vs. 4.10±3.21 b.p.m., P{\textless}0.001), ΔSBP and ΔDBP than the SR group at similar SBP and DBP. A positive correlation existed between ΔPR and ΔSBP (r=0.255, P{\textless}0.001) in AF patients, but no correlation was found in SR subjects. Meanwhile, the ΔSBP in the 0–5 and 6–10 subgroups (9.58±5.61 and 10.67±6.77 vs. 8.45±5.25 mm Hg, nonsignificant) was similar to the SR group, whereas ΔSBP in the 11–15 and {\textgreater}15 subgroups was significantly greater than the SR group. Regardless of ΔPR, the ΔDBP in the AF group was significantly greater than that of the SR group. The AF patients who exhibited greater variability in their PR also had a greater variability in their SBP readings. The SBP measurement for AF patients is accurate as the measurement for patients with SR if the ΔPR is of 0–10 b.p.m. in AF.},

	abstract = {There is little quantitative clinical data available to support blood pressure measurement accuracy during cuff inflation. In this study of 35 male and 5 female lightly anaesthetized subjects aged 64.1 ± 9.6 years, we evaluate and compare the performance of both the oscillometric ratio and gradient methods during cuff deflation and cuff inflation with reference to intra-arterial measurements. We show that the oscillometric waveform envelopes (OWE), which are key to both methods, exhibit significant variability in both shape and smoothness leading to at least 15\% error in the determination of mean pressure (MP). We confirm the observation from our previous studies that K1 Korotkoff sounds underestimate systolic blood pressure (SBP) and note that this underestimation is increased during cuff inflation. The estimation of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is generally accurate for both the ratio and the gradient method, with the latter showing a significant increase during inflation. Since the gradient method estimates SBP and DBP from points of maximum gradient on each OWE recorded, it may offer significant benefits over the ratio method. However, we have shown that the ratio method can be optimized for any data set to achieve either a minimum mean error (ME) of close to 0 mmHg or minimum root mean square error (RMSE) with standard deviation (SD) of {\textless}5.0 mmHg. We conclude that whilst cuff inflation may offer some advantages, these are neither significant nor substantial, leaving as the only benefit, the potential for more rapid measurement and less patient discomfort.},

Objectives  This study aimed to present and evaluate a novel automatic BP measurement method based on deep learning method, and to confirm the effects on measured BPs of the position and contact pressure of stethoscope.    Methods  30 healthy subjects were recruited. 9 BP measurements (from three different stethoscope contact pressures and three repeats) were performed on each subject. The convolutional neural network (CNN) was designed and trained to identify the Korotkoff sounds at a beat-by-beat level. Next, a mapping algorithm was developed to relate the identified Korotkoff beats to the corresponding cuff pressures for systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) determinations. Its performance was evaluated by investigating the effects of the position and contact pressure of stethoscope on measured BPs in comparison with reference manual auscultatory method.    Results  The overall measurement errors of the proposed method were 1.4±2.4mmHg for SBP and 3.3±2.9mmHg for DBP from all the measurements.

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE
A novel automated auscultatory upper-arm cuff blood pressure (BP) monitor for office use (KOROT P3 Accurate, previously InBody BPBIO480KV), which displays Korotkoff sound curves for each BP reading was recently developed. This study investigated whether the review of Korotkoff sound curves by healthcare professionals further improves the accuracy of the device by identifying unreliable BP readings.


METHODS
Three observers assessed independently the morphology of Korotkoff sound curves of BP measurements obtained during an ISO 81060-2:2018 validation study, and classified them as of good, fair, or poor quality (low amplitude or sound intensity, aberrant morphology, background noise, signal artifact, auscultatory gap, irregular rhythm). The observers were blinded to the study BP measurements.


RESULTS
Korotkoff sound curves of 255 BP readings obtained in 85 individuals were analyzed (mean age 57.3 ± 15.0 years, 53 men). Of the SBP readings 80.4/12.2/7.4\% were classified as good/fair/poor, and DBP 76.9/12.2/10.9\%. Inter-observer agreement in detecting poor-quality curves was 84.7/83.1\% (systolic/diastolic). Of poor-quality curves, 10.5/60.7\% (systolic/diastolic) clustered in the same individuals. The validation criterion 1 [mean test-reference BP difference ≤5 ± 8 (SD) mmHg] was satisfied for readings with good (0.1 ± 4.9/0.3 ± 3.8 mmHg, systolic/diastolic) and fair-quality curves (-0.4 ± 6.4/0.2 ± 5.0), but not for poor-quality ones (2.7 ± 8.8/3.6 ± 8.1). By excluding poor-quality readings (40 of 255), criterion 1 of the validation study was improved (0.2 ± 4.9/0.2 ± 3.9 versus 0.3 ± 5.5/0.6 ± 4.7 mmHg).


CONCLUSION
The visual assessment of Korotkoff sounds generated during automated auscultatory BP measurement by the KOROT P3 Accurate professional monitor identifies unreliable readings and further improves the device accuracy.},

	abstract = {AIM: Blood pressure (BP), a key vital sign, monitors general health. Oscillometric devices are increasingly used for measurement, although their accuracy continues to be critically debated. A functional block diagram is used to review the components that affect accuracy.
METHODS: A block diagram is presented covering the components from cuff to algorithm. The oscillometric waveform is described, considering factors that can alter its shape. Methods used to assess accuracy, including the potential use of simulators, are described.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The block diagram focuses attention on cuff, amplifier, signal processing and algorithm. The importance of correct cuff size is emphasized. Accuracy can be affected by the extraction of the oscillometric pulses and the interpolation to compensate for higher deflation rates. Modern electronic amplifiers are assumed to be stable and do not drift, an assumption largely untested. Crucial to accuracy is the algorithm, but there is no standard algorithm and limited theoretical basis, leading to significant measurement errors in groups of patients, even by approved devices. The causes are not well understood, but differences in oscillometric waveform shape between patient groups have been observed and may explain auscultatory-oscillometric differences. The ability of theoretical models to explain the effects of arterial stiffness on BP measurements is discussed. Validation remains statistical though steps have been taken to improve it.
CONCLUSION: The indirect nature of BP measurement poses particularly problems for ensuring accuracy. Critical assessment has done much to improve standards, but a solid theoretical understanding of the technique has not been formulated and further work is required.},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular disease is the number 1 cause of death globally, with elevated blood pressure (BP) being the single largest risk factor. Hence, BP is an important physiological parameter used as an indicator of cardiovascular health. Noninvasive cuff-based automated monitoring is now the dominant method for BP measurement and irrespective of whether the oscillometric or the auscultatory method is used, all are calibrated according to the Universal Standard (ISO 81060-2:2019), which requires two trained operators to listen to Korotkoff K1 sounds for SBP and K4/K5 sounds for DBP. Hence, Korotkoff sounds are fundamental to the calibration of all NIBP devices. In this study of 40 lightly sedated patients, aged 64.1 ± 9.6 years, we compare SBP and DBP recorded directly by intra-arterial fluid filled catheters to values recorded from the onset (SBP-K) and cessation (DBP-K) of Korotkoff sounds. We demonstrate that whilst DBP-K measurements are in good agreement, with a mean difference of −0.3 ± 5.2 mmHg, SBP-K underestimates true intra-arterial SBP (IA-SBP) by an average of 14 ± 9.6 mmHg. The underestimation arises from delays in the re-opening of the brachial artery following deflation of the brachial cuff to below SBP. The reasons for this delay are not known but appear related to the difference between SBP and the pressure under the cuff as blood first begins to flow, as the cuff deflates. Linear models are presented that can correct the underestimation in SBP resulting in estimates with a mean difference of 0.2 ± 7.1 mmHg with respect to intra-arterial SBP.},

We investigated the effects of age, sex, diabetes, CKD stage, and pulse pressure to explain measurement errors defined as biases or misclassification relative to the SBP thresholds of 110–130-mm Hg. \textbf{\textit{Results:}} All 3 techniques showed satisfactory reproducibility for SBP measurement (CCC \&\#x3e; 0.84 and \&\#x3e;0.91, respectively, in dialyzed and nondialyzed patients). The mean ± SD from SBP as determined via Korotkoff sounds was 1.7 ± 4.6 mm Hg for SFATI (CCC = 0.98) and 5.9 ± 9.3 mm Hg for oscillometry (CCC = 0.88). Referring to the 110–130-mm Hg SBP range outside which treatment prescription or adaptation is recommended for CKD patients, SFATI underestimated SBP in 3 patients and overestimated it in 1, whereas oscillometry underestimated SBP in 12 patients and overestimated it in 3. Higher pulse pressure was the main explanatory factor for measurement and classification errors. \textbf{\textit{Discussion/Conclusion:}} SFATI provides accurate SBP measurements in patients with severe CKD and paves the way for the standardization of automated noninvasive blood pressure measurement devices. Before prescribing or adjusting antihypertensive therapy, physicians should be aware of the risk of misclassification when using oscillometry.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: Catheter-directed therapy has been increasingly used in acute pulmonary embolism (PE). Whether ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis (USAT) is superior to standard catheter-directed thrombolysis (SCDT) remains unclear. This is a systemic review and meta-analysis of comparative trials on USAT and SCDT for PE to determine whether either modality yielded better clinical efficacy and safety.
MATERIALS AND METHOD: Major databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science were searched through March 16, 2023. Studies that reported outcomes of SCDT and USAT for acute PE were included. Studies reported data on therapeutic efficacy (a reduction in the right ventricle [RV]/left ventricle [LV] ratio, a reduction in the systolic pulmonary artery pressure [mm Hg], change in Miller index, length of intensive care unit [ICU] and hospital stay) and safety outcomes (in-hospital mortality, overall and major bleeding events).
RESULTS: A total of 9 studies with 2610 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The analysis showed significantly greater improvement in the RV/LV ratio in the SCDT group than in the USAT group (mean difference [MD]: -0.155; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: -0.249 to -0.006). No statistically significant differences were found between groups comparing change in systolic pulmonary artery pressure (MD: 0.592 mm Hg; 95\% CI: -2.623 to 3.807), change in Miller index (MD: -4.1\%; 95\% CI: -9.5 to 1.3\%), hospital stay (MD: 0.372 days; 95\% CI: -0.972 to 1.717), and ICU stay (MD: -0.073.038 days; 95\% CI: -1.184 to 1). No significant difference was noted in safety outcomes, including in-hospital mortality (pooled odds ratio: 0.984; 95\% CI: 0.597 to 1.622), and major bleeding (pooled odds ratio: 1.162; 95\% CI: 0.714 to 1.894).
CONCLUSIONS: In our meta-analysis of observational and randomized studies, USAT is not superior to SCDT in patients with acute PE.INSPLAY registration number: INPLASY202240082.
CLINICAL IMPACT: This study compared SCDT and USAT in patients with acute pulmonary embolism. We found no additional benefit in PA pressure change, thrombus reduction, hospital stay, mortality and major bleeding rate. Additional study using consistent treatment protocol is necessary for further investigation.},

The rate ratio of all-cause in-hospital mortality and risk of amputation during the same period of hospital stay were estimated using Generalized linear models (GLM). There was no significant difference in mortality risk between CDT and surgical intervention (9.5\% vs. 10.68\%, adjusted rate ratio (95\% CI): regression 1.0 [0.79-1.27], PS matching 0.92 [0.69-1.23]). The risk of amputation was also comparable between the two groups. (13.59\% vs. 14.81\%, adjusted rate ratio (95\% CI): regression 0.84 [0.68-1.02], PS matching 0.92 [0.72-1.17]). Age (p {\textless} 0.001) and liver disease (p = 0.01) were associated with higher mortality risks. Heart failure (p = 0.03) and chronic or end-stage renal disease (p = 0.03) were associated with higher amputation risks. Prior antithrombotic agent use (p = 0.03) was associated with a reduced risk of amputation. Both surgical intervention and CDT are effective and feasible procedures for patients with ALI in Taiwan.},

	abstract = {Introduction:
              Vascular access (VA) is essential for patients with hemodialysis, and its dysfunction is a major complication that can reduce quality of life or even threaten life. VA patency is not only difficult to predict on an individual basis, but also challenging to predict in real-time. To overcome this challenge, this study aimed to develop a machine learning approach to predict 6-month primary patency (PP) using photoplethysmography (PPG) signals acquired from the tips of both index fingers.
            
            
              Materials and methods:
              PPG signals were obtained from hemodialysis patients who received an arteriovenous fistula or an arteriovenous graft as primary VA in a single center from April 2023 to December 2023. With PPG wearables, we propose a method that can efficiently and quickly generate the morphological features of the PPG signal to recognize different groups of patients. For the generated features, an independent sample t-test was used to evaluate their effectiveness for machine learning. Then, two supervised learning algorithms, k-nearest neighbors (kNN) and support vector machine (SVM), are used further to identify VA patency in advance.
            
            
              Results:
              The study involved 31 patients, of whom 14 had 6-month PP, while 17 did not. Using the kNN algorithm, machine learning classified patients into two groups with 82\% precision based on PPG signals, while the SVM algorithm showed a precision of 82\%.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              Our approach can provide reliable classifications for VA patency. It is effective to use the proposed PPG signal features to predict 6-month PP of VA.},

	abstract = {Blood pressure measurement is the most widely performed clinical exam to predict mortality risk. The gold standard for its noninvasive assessment is the auscultatory method, which relies on listening to the so-called “Korotkoff sounds” in a stethoscope placed at the outlet of a pneumatic arm cuff. However, more than a century after their discovery, the origin of these sounds is still debated, which implies a number of clinical limitations. We imaged the Korotkoff sound generation in vivo at thousands of images per second using ultrafast ultrasound. We showed with both experience and theory that Korotkoff sounds are paradoxically not sound waves emerging from the brachial artery but rather shear vibrations conveyed in surrounding tissues by the nonlinear pulse wave propagation. When these shear vibrations reached the stethoscope, they were synchronous, correlated, and comparable in intensity with the Korotkoff sounds. Understanding this mechanism could ultimately improve blood pressure measurement and provide additional understanding of arterial mechanical properties.
